# Practice Problem 15
# Given this data structure write some code to return an array
# which contains only the hashes where all the integers are even.

arr = [{a: [1, 2, 3]}, {b: [2, 4, 6], c: [3, 6], d: [4]}, {e: [8], f: [6, 10]}]

=begin
Rephrase: Find all hashes that ONLY contain even integers and return an array containing them
Basic example: [{b: [2,4,6}]
P INPUT: 3 element array
  OUTPUT: array
  Rules:
        Explicit: Array is given
                  All values of inner hashes are arrays of numbers
