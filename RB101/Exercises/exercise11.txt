My favorite Ruby API is Enumerable. Enumerable has a number of methods that make many common tasks very easy to implement. 
  Methods like each, map and reduce make expressing myself in Ruby very easy compared to other languages. When I was learning other languages I sometimes struggled implementing my ideas into code.
  However, with Ruby and Enumerable I'm able to focus on the problem instead of fighting syntax.
