# After Midnight (Part 1)
# The time of day can be represented as the number of minutes before or after
# midnight. If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight. If
# the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight.

# Write a method that takes a time using this minute-based format and returns
# the time of day in 24 hour format (hh:mm).  Your method should work with any
# integer input.

# You may not use ruby's Date and Time classes.
