#Find the Duplicate
=begin
Problem:
Given an unordered array and the information that exactly one value in the array
occurs twice (every other value occurs exactly once), how would you determine
which value occurs twice? Write a method that will find and return the duplicate
value that is known to be in the array.
  Rephrase: return the duplicate value from an unordered array
Examples/tests:

find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1
find_dup([18,  9, 36, 96, 31, 19, 54, 75, 42, 15,
          38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
          14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
          78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
          89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
          41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
          55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
          85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
          40, 23, 71,62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
          7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73
INPUT: Array
  Containing integer elements
OUTPUT: int
Rules:
    Explicit:
  1 value is duplicated 
    Implicit: duplicate value doesn't need to be removed from original array
D:Array

Approach:
Define method find_dup with parameter arr
sort arr
iterate through arr
if current value is == to previous value return value
C:
=end

def find_dup(arr)
  sorted = arr.sort
  count = 0
  loop do 
    break if count == arr.size
    return sorted[count] if sorted[count] == sorted[count + 1]

    count += 1
  end
end

find_dup([1, 5, 3, 1]) == 1

          38, 25, 97, 92, 46, 69, 91, 59, 53, 27,
          14, 61, 90, 81,  8, 63, 95, 99, 30, 65,
          78, 76, 48, 16, 93, 77, 52, 49, 37, 29,
          89, 10, 84,  1, 47, 68, 12, 33, 86, 60,
          41, 44, 83, 35, 94, 73, 98,  3, 64, 82,
          55, 79, 80, 21, 39, 72, 13, 50,  6, 70,
          85, 87, 51, 17, 66, 20, 28, 26,  2, 22,
          40, 23, 71,62, 73, 32, 43, 24,  4, 56,
          7,  34, 57, 74, 45, 11, 88, 67,  5, 58]) == 73
